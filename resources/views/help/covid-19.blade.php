        <h1>IFS Notice - COVID-19</H1>
        <p>Due to the COVID-19 situation In order to ensure operational continuity and keep connecting the world with a high-quality service our carriers have applied a levy -  Emergency Situation Surcharge. This allows necessary adjustments to be made to the air networks  during this situation. This applies to Courier Express (International shipments) only.</p>
        <p>IFS are working hard to maintain your local and global supply chains as normal, the impact of COVID-19 is however causing local, UK and Global  Governments to issue some work and travel restrictions on a daily basis in some areas</p>
        <p>This is impacting our ability to complete deliveries to some areas in the normal transit times.</p>
        <p>Please note there is no guarantee on transit times and some shipments may indeed incur extended transit times.</p>
